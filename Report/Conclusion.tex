\section{Conclusion}
We presented many field of procedural generation, as well as many solutions on those topics, many of which can be performed in real-time. There are many other field of research we did not scratch in this report, such as generation of flora and fauna on both large and small scale, weather simulation, procedural city generation or agent-based simulation. Real-time applications generate solutions with plausibility in mind, but not physical correctness. Nonetheless such results are stunningly looking and can be easily mistaken for real data sets. This does not mean, any kind of unrealistic terrains can be created, usually the rules of physical correctness are weakened and simplified in order to achieve real-time performance. Those applications are mainly used for content creation. Applications that aim for correctness, usually cannot be computed in real time. Physical correct simulations rely on heavy computing, with an exact result in mind. Often a combination of several approaches result in realistic and (partly) correct systems at reasonable computation time and artistic resources.
