\section{Fast Hydraulic Erosion Simulation and Visualisation on GPU}
The behaviour of water massively influences the look and features of a terrain. Depending on the timespawn, amount of water, ground composition and many more factors, hydraulic erosion creates a variety of different, but distinctive ground deformations, such as ripples, ridges, meanders, riverruns and valleys. 
This paper presents an approach capable of creating such deformations in short amount of time, making it suitable for interactive visualization. The model represents terrain and water surfaces using heightfield, which is sampled onto a regular grid. A shallow water model is used to update the water surfaces and the fluid velocity field. The focus on this paper does not lie on flow simulation, therefore we will not go into this matter deeply.
