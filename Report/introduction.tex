\section{Introduction}
Terrain modeling and representation is a elaborated topic in computer graphics and visualization. Traditional content creation requires a vast part of development recources. Therefore it is only plausible to look for new solutions, that allows for faster, more accurate and physically plausible terrain generation and representation. This report elaborates a handful of different solutions, that approach seeral differnt tasks in terrain generation. 
We will highlight several techniques on terrain modeling, datastructures and rendering approaches. 
Furthermore this report presents several solution for more physically correct erosion simulations based on hydrology and heat transfer, as well as tectonic plate movement
