\section{Introduction}
Terrain modeling and representation is a elaborated topic in computer graphics and visualization. Traditional content creation requires a vast part of development recources. Therefore it is only plausible to look for more soqisticated solutions, that allows for faster, more accurate and physically plausible terrain generation and representation. This report elaborates a handful of different solutions, that approach several different tasks in terrain generation. 
We will highlight several techniques on terrain modeling, datastructures and rendering approaches. 
Furthermore this report presents several solution for more physically correct erosion simulations based on hydrology and heat transfer, as well as tectonic plate movement


%%modern terrain representations that exceed in both functionality and practicality over the traditional height field approach

%%Geologically spoken rivernetworks are created by an interplay of water and the terrain. Waterflow adpats to the terrain, as well as the terrain gets adapted to the waterflow eventually. We will talk about the influence of water
